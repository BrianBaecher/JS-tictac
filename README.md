So I ran into an issue immediately. In the initial commit I was using a foreach to set up the event listeners thru arrow notation

IDK how to remove event listeners from anonymous functions --- so each time you clicked the listeners doubled -- pushing duplicate values into the array.

After unsuccesfully trying to find a way to change that I'm going with a more brutish angle.


*/
win conditions... need to find an appropriate array method for this

potential candidates -- includes -- join -- 

 1,2,3 -- 1,4,7 -- 1,5,9
 4,5,6 -- 7,8,9 -- 2,5,8
3,5,7 -- 3,6,9
